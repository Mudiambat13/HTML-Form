# Contact form 

This form is an example of a responsive html css contact form with bootstrap that allows you to switch between registering and logging in with a single click. It uses the following bootstrap components:

- A map to display the form in a container with a header and a body.
- Navigation tabs to create the two tabs for registration and login.
- Forms with form groups, labels, entries and buttons.

The form also uses custom css code to modify the style of the card and form elements, as well as a jQuery script to enable switching between tabs. The form sends the data entered by the user to separate php files for registration and login, which must be implemented according to the desired business logic. The form is adapted to different devices and screen sizes thanks to the bootstrap responsive grid system.
